# Portfolio 2022

## Project Description:

This 2022 portfolio site uses *React* and *3.js* to display my latest projects from Github. This is a single page application that has helped instill the knowledge I have gained over the last few months whilst undertaking courses in **React**, **Typescript** and **3.js**. Features include:
  - 3D Web element in react using *@react-three/fiber*
  - Dynamic repository data collection using Github API
  - CSS transitions/animations using *react-transition-group*
  - Simplified UI development using some *Semantic UI components* 

## Deployment:
